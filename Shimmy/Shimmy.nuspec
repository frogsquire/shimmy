    <description>Shimmy is an easy-to-use mocking framework based on Pose. Like Pose, Shimmy helps you test your code by replacing calls to methods (including static, non-virtual and even private methods) with delegates (shims). However, with Shimmy, you don't have to write these delegates yourself.

Instead, simply point Shimmy at the method under test, and it will deconstruct said method and generate shims for any calls within it. Then, you can tell Shimmy how those delegates should behave. The work of writing shims is handled entirely by the library, leaving you free to focus on writing tests. Plus, Shimmy's delegates keep records of the parameters passed to them each time they're called, so you can use them to verify that your program is performing correctly.

Shimmy is based on .NET Standard 2.0 and includes robust cross-platform support.</description>
